# hw3

What code draws the blades of grass?
function draw() {
  stroke(random(60, 70), 100, 90);
  line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
  
What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
x = x + 10

What's the point of the h variable?


What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h) ? Why is it there?
